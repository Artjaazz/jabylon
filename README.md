Jabylon
=======

Jabylon is an extensible web based translation tool that helps managing and translating java property files to different locales.
The built-in team support for (currently) Git and CVS allows Jabylon to check out projects, update them regulary and commit the translations back into the team repository.

* Binaries can be downloaded from the [CI Server](https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/jutzig/job/jabylon/de.jutzig.jabylon$de.jutzig.jabylon/)
* A [live demo](https://demo-jabylon.rhcloud.com) with some imported sample projects is available to try it out
