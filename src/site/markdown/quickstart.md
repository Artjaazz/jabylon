# Quick Start

The quickest way to get Jabylon up and running is to  [download](./download.html)  the standalone product and extract it to a destination of your choice.

The standalone product includes an OSGi framework and an embedded jetty server.
Once extracted, open a shell and `cd` to the directory. From there you can start the server by typing

`./jabylon start`

Jabylon will be reachable on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
You can now log in with the default username `Administrator` and password `changeme`.
To stop the server, execute 

`./jabylon stop`.

For further configuration options see the [Installation Guide].(/installation.html).
At this point, Jabylon is fully functional and you should be able to create a new project through the configuration interface.
