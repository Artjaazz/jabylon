# Permissions on Projects

The easiest way to handle permissions is by doing it on a per-project basis. The permissions are the same as in the [global permissions](globalPermissions.html "Global Permissions") but the user interface is more intuitive on project level.

In each project you can assign permissions to roles(1) and individual users(2). When you want to grant a new permission, make your selection and press the respective _Add_ button (3).

Your changes will not become effective until you press the _Submit_ button.

Please note that permissions are cumulative so you can not reduce the permissions on a per-user level if said user already inherited certain permissions by a role.

You should also note that _Configure_, _Edit_ and _View_ subsume each other in that order, i.e. if a user has the _Configure_ permission, he automatically is able to _Edit_ and _View_ the project as well.
