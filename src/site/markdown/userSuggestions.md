# User Suggestions

Jabylon allows users to suggest new translations or changes to existing ones. This can be useful if you want to allow your community to contribute translations without granting _Edit_ permissions to modify translations directly.

Suggestions can be reviewed and applied or rejected by users with _Edit_ permission for the project in question. To enable suggestions, grant the _Suggest_ permission to a role (e.g. _Registered_ or _Anonymous_) without granting the same role the _Edit_ permissions.

Users with those access rights will now be able to use the same translation UI as regular translators, but their changes will not be stored directly. Instead each change generates a _Suggestion_ that can be reviewed and applied or rejected by users with _Edit_ permissions.

These suggestions are shown together with the automatic checks in the translation tool section at the bottom of the page.

To accept a suggestion press the icon at (1) and save. To reject it, press the **Reject** button. Automatic translation checks can be rejected in the same way. They will reappear automatically if you change the translation and the problem still persists.
